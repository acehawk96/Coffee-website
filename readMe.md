 ### Description:

This is my first functional website promoting some amazing coffee shops and my love for coffee! 

I developed this using HTML and CSS. 

This was a school project but the idea and look of the website was left completely up to me. 

Later on, I have been consistantly updating the user interface of the page to create a pleasing aesthetic.

Thank you for viewing!
